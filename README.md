Hello, my name is Warren Chemerika, I am a Web Developer based in Vancouver, BC, with a strong background in front-end development and growing experience across the full stack. My interest in programming started in grade 7, when I taught myself HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript to build small Counter-Strike websites. During high school I took each computer science course available, in these courses I experimented with Python and Java, one year receiving the school’s IT award. After high school, I attended the University of Saskatchewan for a time, taking courses in computer science, psychology, and health sciences—giving me a broader understanding of both people and technology. Now, I have focused my path on web development, completing certifications at Saskatchewan Polytechnic and BCIT, both with strong results through practical, project-based learning.

Professionally, I have contributed to projects in both freelance and agency environments, gaining hands-on experience with technologies such as WordPress, React, Node.js, and GraphQL. In addition to client work, I develop and maintain personal projects featured on my portfolio site, ihawp.com. My development approach emphasizes performance optimization, maintainable code, and responsive design to ensure reliable and scalable applications.

Beyond technical ability, I bring a strong problem-solving instinct and a drive to improve with every project completed. While much of my growth has come through independent learning and experimentation, I thrive in team environments where ideas are shared freely and quality is a shared priority. I'm particularly motivated when working alongside others who are equally invested in building thoughtful, high-standard solutions. I find it imperative to take ownership of my work, adapt to challenges quickly, and stay focused on delivering reliable, well-executed results. I believe that every moment of life is an opportunity to learn.
